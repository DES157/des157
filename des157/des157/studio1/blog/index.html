			<p><em>January 12, 2017</em> <br> Although Uber's website can be
			overstimulating and a bit busy visually, I really enjoy the simplicity
			and ease to order a ride. The interface really integrates the look and
			feel of technology and the iphone with landscapes and map photos to successfully
			present their product in an effective way. The motion and interactivity are particularly
			appealing.</p>
