			<p>I really enjoy dribbble.com's user interface. The design is very clean and straight forward with a clear hierarchy. A user can easily navigate the page and dribbble offers hover features for the dropdown menu at the top and for each post giving a detailed description of the design entry. The interface uses primarily grays and white with one pink spot color for the "sign-up" button. This works well to allow the design entries to be the main display of color, attracting the user's interest. The interface is very clear and organized, with all information contained clearly to each section.The website appears simple and shows good restraint of design, allowing the user's eye to flow naturally to the work that catches their eye best by aesthetic preference. </p>

			<p>Although Uber's website can be
			overstimulating and a bit busy visually, I really enjoy the simplicity
			and ease to order a ride. The interface really integrates the look and
			feel of technology and the iphone with landscapes and map photos to successfully
			present their product in an effective way. The motion and interactivity are particularly
			appealing.</p>
