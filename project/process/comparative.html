            <h3>Dumb Ways to Die</h3>
            <p>
                Dumb Ways to Die is an app game that focuses on literally <em>dumb ways to die</em> such as getting hit by a baseball bat while the character is in a garbage bag. It's a morbid but simple game. The app gives you one line directions but
                if you fail, these innocent looking characters are killed in rather graphic methods as shown in the image to the left. The app utilizes the smartphone like tilting the screen and swiping at the touchscreen.
            </p>

            <h3>Survive! Mola mola!</h3>
            <p>
                The next project is another app game called Survive! Mola Mola! Similar to Dumb Ways to Die, your goal is to keep your little sunfish (called a mola mola) alive. Also very similar, there's the concept of dying in dumb ways as well. In the beginning the
                sunfish is weak and vulnerable, dying even from eating too much or being "touched" too much.
            </p>

            <h3>Takeaways</h3>
            <p>I like the simplicity of the concept and the morbid undertones juxtapoised against the cute but violent graphics.</p>
