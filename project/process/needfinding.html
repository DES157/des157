        <p>Step 1: Observe Watching how other people do things is a great way to learn user goals and values Observe the successes, breakdowns and latent opportunities that occur when another person (hopefully in the target audience) interacts with a similar
            system Partner with a student from class or a friend outside of class and have them interact with one of the comparative projects that you identified in your comparative research Document your observation (notes, drawings, photos, etc)
            <br><br> Step 2: Brainstorm Review your outcomes from step 1 and brainstorm a list of at least 7 specific user needs for your final project Use phrases such as "needs a way" or "needs to be able to"</p>

        <h4>Brainstorm User needs</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>needs to be able to have enough time to read instructions</li>
            <li>needs to have time between each task</li>
            <li></li>
            <li></li>
