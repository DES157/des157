			<h2>World's Resources Origins and Current State</h2>
        <p>I have decided to focus on where major resources in the world come from and visually display which countries have resources in abundance. While doing my comparative research studies I found that the World Resource Institute tries to accomplish a similar goal of sharing resources and alerting where there is a need, but I would like to expand on this idea by showing where the specific resource is in abundance on a global scale. I hope that my idea could have a similar impact to the WRI in increasing awareness and bringing these resources to the communities in need.</p>
