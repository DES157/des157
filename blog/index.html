          <h2>The iPhone Weather App</h2>
          <h3>January 11, 2017</h3>
          <p>I’ve used many ugly smart phone apps, and I’ve played lots of
            visually pleasing video games, but one of my favorite apps it the
            iPhone weather app. It has been updated lots of times and has
            developed into a useful and beautiful interface.</p>
          <p>All of the important information about the current temperature and
            weather are big and bold at the top so that it’s easy to find. It
            has the forecast for the week next, and then details about humidity
            etc. The layout is simple, easy to navigate, and is very pretty.</p>
          <p>Beyond the layout, the background is also both useful and very
            beautiful. The app turns the screen of a phone into a representation
            of the sky outside in a given city. It looks like something straight
            out of the Harry Potter books. The reflection of the sky reminds me
            of the enchantment in the Great Hall at Hogwarts. The clouds, and
            stars are very convincing, but my favorite is the rain. Though it’s
            gorgeous the background is also very descriptive of what the weather
            might look like outside.</p>
          <p>I use the weather app daily to guide my choice in wardrobe,
            activities, and means of transportation. I couldn’t think of a
            better way to get the weather, besides walking out into the world of
            course!</p>
