                <p>I originally wanted to try creating an isometric map with a controllable player but the libraries I was checking out looked too complicated. I also realized that I could possibly use processing, therefore the p5 library because of how
                    similar the coding was.</p>
                    <p> Instead I decided to focus on another element I wanted to implement which is the customization of the robot character. This included dragging and dropping. </p>
                    <p> I believe the library is simple enough once you get the hang of it, however it was hard to figure out where to begin because of the terminology however, they have a comprehensive guide on their github (linked below). I also realized after fiddling around that this library is good for organizing and probably not for what I want
                    it to do such as logging in information.

                    I wanted the main interaction to be the letters that represent each day of the week, hence the reason why they're a different, brighter color compared to the other text. This also relies on users intuition; when the cursor changes to a pointer, they know it's a link, so they press on it. I changed the cursor on the rest of the text to be default so that the users will focus mostly on hovering over and clicking. When the letters with the tooltips are clicked, a playlist pops out.
                </p>

                <p>
                    There are technically three pieces that can be interacted with however they're meant to be stumbled upon or it lends itself to the users curiousity. For example, the title "Time was never on my side" can be accidentally triggered when the mouse path goes
                    through it. The result are different phrases in a timed sequence.</p>

                <p>Meanwhile, when hovering over the classes, the days of the week highlight correspondingly. Friday is not highlighted (because I have no class), so this is to heighten the user's curiousity so that they would hover over it to find out there's
                    a tooltip. </p>

                    I designed this studio to be straightforward as possible. It's almost reminiscent of online games where there's a icon of the person talking, a speech bubble, and the information about the object selected.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The jackets are in grayscale so when you hover over each one, the colors transitioned back. When you click on one of the jackets, it'll appear in the container next to it with a little description at the bottom. The icon has three reactions, one of them
                    being used once so look carefully! And last but not least, just in case someone hovers over the icon, there's a message that states nothing interesting will happen.

            <h1>web based form</h1>
            <h5> or why does it take me too long to fill these out</h5>

                <h1>ENTRY 2 | WEB BASED FORM</h1>
                <img src="images/slackForm.PNG" alt="slack sign in form">

                <p>
                    Slack is strange in the sense that you can sign in for different teams but with different emails and passwords. So before you actually sign up, you sign into a team first and then use the email and password associated with that team to sign in.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Slack has what most sign in forms have: minimalism (the screenshot is an edit that includes both signing into the team and in general), a big color button, and lower hierarchy of text and colors underneath the input area. However, I feel like slack could
                    have condensed the two forms into one. The essence of a sign in form is usually one page: username/email and password, so having to do a two page process is unnecesary.
                </p>

            <h1>user interface</h1>
            <h5> or my subtle hate letter to icons</h5>

            <section>
                <h1>ENTRY 1 | INTERFACE</h1>
                <img src="images/01_tumblr_design.png" alt="tumblr app interface design">
                <p>The first thing that popped into my head was the app I use the most: the Tumblr app. I feel like my evaluation of the user interface might be skewed because of how accustomed I am with the icons and the site but that would contribute to
                    the effectiveness of the app/site.</p>

                <p>Overall, the app is simple in visual design. It does not overwhlem with too many unlabeled or new icons (TALKING ABOUT YOU SNAPCHAT). For example, it has a different format for showing different information (recommended blogs are horizontally
                    placed while already followed blogs scroll vertically). And if you want to follow a blog, you don't have to guess which icon because it spells the word out for you. </p>

                <p> Starting from the top highlighted box, there are two icons that should be familiar to most social media users: (from the left) the heart and the reblog button. The next two icons however might not be familiar (although this is the only
                    social media app besides Facebook). The speech bubble can be inferred as an icon that relates to talking to other users and that is true, however it's not a messaging system - the icon for that is at the bottom with a face. The arrow-looking
                    icon on the top highlighted box is the one that works together with the messaging system. The user can send the post through the messaging system to another user. Other than that, the rest of the icons are effective in showing what
                    it's meant to be used for.
                </p>
