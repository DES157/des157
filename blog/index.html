				<h2>FORMS (16PERSONALITIES)</h2>
				<p>One web-based form that I use occasionally is 16personalities, an online test that tells a user their Myers-Briggs type upon completion of the form. As a whole, the form is very easy to use, easy to accessible, and even enjoyable to complete. Its use of color to indicate a sense of scale effectively communicates a spectrum, without being too overt. In addition, the colors complement the feel of the website and the feel of a personality test as well. Its use of radio buttons allow the user to select the "rank" they feel the question applies to them, which lets the user pick a relatively distinct degree without being to complicated (in comparison to using a slider or text input). Lastly, because the form is split into different pages, it doesn't feel tiring to complete the form.</p>

				<h2>USER INTERFACES (GOOGLE MAPS)</h2>
				<p>One user interface that I think is well-designed and that I use on a frequent basis is Google Maps. To me, finding directions and getting a general sense of where I am is quickly accessible and naturally intuitive; although the map itself takes up the whole viewport, I am able to search Google Maps in the form that is clearly separated and has placeholder text that tells me to search. Once I type in something that I want to search, many icons and buttons appear that are clearly labeled that could serve as possible actions that I want to proceed with. Usually, I click the Directions button, which brings up another interface that uses icons to communicate a mode of transportation. <br><br> When showing me possible routes to take, the information is clearly organized using a grid to separate each route, as well as Gestalt principles of proximity and grouping to put related information (like travel time and distance v. mode of transportation and route name) together. The routes themselves are labeled using simple colors to help the user guide through the directions and even uses direct labeling to show a travel time and distance comparison, a method which allows the user to pick a route that works for them while conveying meaningful information. Lastly, in addition to keeping with the general Google color palette, the color selection itself is easy on the eyes and non-stressful, useful for situations that can often be stressful, like trying to figure out where you are and where to go at any given moment.</p>
